# 1 Open Badges 

## 2 Vision 
> Open Badges are the leading standard for innovative credentials. They are not specific to a product or platform. They are designed to be verifiable, portable, and packed with information about skills and achievements.
* Open Badges do not serve the majority world. 
* Badge issuing systems have expensive subscription models
* Badge backpacka arenot available for those to be stored on in South Africa (as far as I know) and other african countries

| 01 | Light weight badge created with CSS | Bryan Fillmer has a great example https://codepen.io/bfillmer/pen/rNWWBz. I also got CHAT GPT to help me out https://codepen.io/Web-learning-the-bold/pen/OJGjGaG | A lightweight badge in CSS that can be modified https://weblearning.co.za/badges/test/| 
| 02 | JSON files that capture badge information | WebDevSimplified has got a good primer on YouTube  | To fetch in data from a separate json file www.webdevsimplified.com. I liked this codepen that pulled in JSOn data from https://codepen.io/stevenventimiglia/pen/GEEoPe | 
| 03 | Go recursivly through the whole JSON file into the light weight badge | Good avice to put JSON file in a gist and link to the raw file. See https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-do-i-add-the-local-json-file-in-fetch-api-in-codepen/274890| |
