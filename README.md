# Open Badges 

> Open Badges are the leading standard for innovative credentials. They are not specific to a product or platform. They are designed to be verifiable, portable, and packed with information about skills and achievements.
* Open Badges do not serve the majority world. 
* Badge issuing systems have expensive subscription models
* Badge backpacka arenot available for those to be stored on in South Africa (as far as I know) and other african countries
